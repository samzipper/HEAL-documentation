# The HEAL Syllabus
This is a collection of papers and other resources that I find particularly good for 'getting your feet wet' with some of the research we do in HEAL. 

## Groundwater sustainability

## Kansas water resources
 - *[Sustainability of aquifers supporting irrigated agriculture: A case study of the High Plains Aquifer in Kansas](http://doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2018.1515566) by Jim Butler et al.

 ## Socio-environmental synthesis
 - *Sanderson et al. (2017). [Bringing the “social” into sociohydrology: Conservation policy support in the Central Great Plains of Kansas, USA](http://doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020659).

## Open science
 - [Data organization in spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) by Broman & Woo. Think you know how to organize your spreadsheets? I bet there's something in here you're not doing...

## Data visualization
 - [Choosing colors for data visualization](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors/) by Lisa Charlotte Rost.
 - [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke.
 - [List of 20 simple, distinct colors](https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/) by Sasha Trubetskoy. Make sure to explore the 'accessibility' options at the top to filter for potential types of colorblindness.
 
## Advancing your career
 - [Creating a research brand](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6249/758) by Jeff McDonnell.
 - [The importance of stupidity in scientific research](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771) by Martin Schwartz.

## Effective collaboration
 - [Ten simple rules for collaboratively writing a multi-authored paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006508) by Frassl et al. This is relevant to the entire research process, not just the writing step!
